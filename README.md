## Iteration 2: Data Flow Operations

> Iteration 2: Add JDBC & GSON to your Maven project, read the contents of a CSV, and insert this into the provided database.
  You will need to insert into "author" from the json file (the three fields in the json file)
  And "book" with some of the information from the csv file (see bottom)
